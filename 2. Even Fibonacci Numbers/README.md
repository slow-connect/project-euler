## Problem
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}, \quad F_1 = 1, \quad F_2 = 2$$
What is the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which do not exceed four million?

## Idea:
- Use a loop and not a recursion to speed up the calculation.
- Even Fibonacci-numbers are every third Fibonacci-number.

## Code:
see [here](https://github.com/slow-connect/project-euler/blob/main/2.%20Even%20Fibonacci%20Numbers/main.py) for the code.
