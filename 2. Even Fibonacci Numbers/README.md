## Problem
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}, \quad F_1 = 1, \quad F_2 = 2$$
What is the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which do not exceed four million?
## Idea:
- Use a loop and not a recursion to speed up the calculation.
- Even Fibonacci-numbers are every third Fibonacci-number.
## Code:
