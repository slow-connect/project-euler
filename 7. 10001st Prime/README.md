# 7. $10001$st Prime

## Problem
By listing the first six prime numbers: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11$, and $13$, we can see that the $6$th prime is $13$.

What is the $10001$st prime number?

## Idea:
- We use the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) to find the $10001$st prime number.
- We could use the Sieve of Eratosthenes recursively faster, but this is not necessary for this problem, we can adapt the `for` loop to be fast enough.

## Code:
see [here]() for the code.
