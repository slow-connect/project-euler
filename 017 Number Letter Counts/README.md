# 17. Number Letter Counts - Project Euler

[Website](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17)

_Created: 2024-02-17_

## Problem

If the numbers $1$ to $5$ are written out in words: `one`, `two`, `three`, `four`, `five`, then there are $3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19$ letters used in total.

If all the numbers from $1$ to $1000$ (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

## Idea:
- Each number conbines into four parts: `thousand`, `hundred`, `tens`, `ones`.
- For each part, we can calculate the number of letters used.

## Code
For the code see [here](https://github.com/slow-connect/project-euler/blob/main/017%20Number%20Letter%20Counts/main.py)
