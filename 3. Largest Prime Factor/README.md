## Problem
What is the largest prime factor of the number $n = 600851475143$ ?

## Idea:
- We can loop until `sqrt(n)` and check if the number is divisible by $n$.
- If it is divisible, we check if the number is prime (which can be done fast)

## Code:
see [here](https://github.com/slow-connect/project-euler/blob/main/3.%20Largest%20Prime%20Factor/main.py) for the code.
