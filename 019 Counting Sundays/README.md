## Problem

You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

- 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
- Thirty days has September,
- April, June and November.
- All the rest have thirty-one,
- Saving February alone,
- Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
- And on leap years, twenty-nine.
- A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

## Idea

- We know that 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
- From that day 0, we go over the month of each year and count the number of Sundays that fall on the first of the month.
