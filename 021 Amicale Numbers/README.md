## Problem

Let $d(n)$ be defined as the sum of proper divisors of (numbers less than $n$ which divide evenly into $n$). If $d(a) = b$ and $d(b) = a$, where $a\neq b$, then $a$ and $b$ are an amicable pair and each of $a$ and $b$ are called amicable numbers.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under $10000$.
