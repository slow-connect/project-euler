## Problem

$n!$ means $n \times (n - 1) \times \ldots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$

For example, $10! = 10 \times 9 \times \ldots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 3628800$,
and the sum of the digits in the number $10!$ is $3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27$.

Find the sum of the digits in the number $100!$.

## Idea

- I suppose that the number $100!$ is too large to be calculated directly.
- So we can't just brute-force the calculation.
- Well, trying it out, turns out, that you can calculate $100!$ directly.
- The sum of the digits can be calculated by converting the number to a string and summing the digits.
