## Problem
$2520$ is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from $1$ to $10$ without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from $1$ to $20$?

## Idea:
- Numbers from $1$ to $20$ are not all primes, some are a composition of smaller primes.
- We can use this to our advantage.
- We can find all primes from $1$ to $20$ and multiply them all together to get the result.
