## Problem
The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.$ The first ten terms would be:

$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...$$

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

$$\begin{aligned}
& 1: 1 \\
& 3: 1,3 \\
& 6: 1,2,3,6 \\
& 10: 1,2,5,10 \\
& 15: 1,3,5,15 \\
& 21: 1,3,7,21 \\
& 28: 1,2,4,7,14,28 \\
\end{aligned}$$

We can see that $28$ is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

## Idea
- We use the Euler Formula to calculate each number
$$\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$
- We use, that each factor appears in pairs, so we only need to check until $\sqrt{n}$
- We count the number of factors, and if $\sqrt{n}$ is an integer, we count it only once.
- When we find a number with more then $500$ factors, we print it and stop the program.

## Code
See [here](https://github.com/slow-connect/project-euler/blob/main/12.%20Highly%20Divisible%20Triangular%20Number/main.py) for the code.

This runs on my computer for about 3.5s, so there is probabily room for improvement, but it is fast enough for me.
